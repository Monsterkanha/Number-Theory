We can see there will be n -1 right path and m-1 down
so our answer is just permutaion of these.

so total = m+n-2 c m-1
since all identical so placing is 1.


For the eg., given in question, 3x7 matrix, robot needs to take 2+6 = 8 steps with 2 down and 6 right in any order. That is nothing but a permutation problem. Denote down as 'D' and right as 'R', following is one of the path :-

D R R R D R R R

public int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        if(m == 1 || n == 1)
            return 1;
        m--;
        n--;
        if(m < n) {              // Swap, so that m is the bigger number
            m = m + n;
            n = m - n;
            m = m - n;
        }
        long res = 1;
        int j = 1;
        for(int i = m+1; i <= m+n; i++, j++){       // Instead of taking factorial, keep on multiply & divide
            res *= i;
            res /= j;
        }
            
        return (int)res;
    }
