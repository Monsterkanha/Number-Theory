# Some Famous Conjecture about prime numbers.

There are many conjectures involving primes. Most people think that the conjectures are true, but nobody has been able to prove them. For example, the
following conjectures are famous:
• Goldbach’s conjecture: Each even integer n > 2 can be represented as a
sum n = a+ b so that both a and b are primes.
• Twin prime conjecture: There is an infinite number of pairs of the form
{p, p +2}, where both p and p +2 are primes.
• Legendre’s conjecture: There is always a prime between numbers n2 and (n+1)2, where n is any positive integer.
